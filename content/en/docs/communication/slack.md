Slack is used for:

- Internal-only communication and announcements impacting all team members
- Labs newsletters and team updates
- Asynchronous questions and quick collaboration
- Informal communication

## Etiquette
We try to follow the [following etiquette](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack) when using Slack.

## Managing noise and creating focus in Slack
### Organizing your Slack sidebar by priority
Consider using Slack's <b>[Starred channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201331016-Star-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> function to spotlight three categories of channels, its <b>[Mute function](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> to quiet channels which are pulling your focus away too often, and most importantly, its **Mark all messages as read** function (easily toggled by pressing `Shift` and `Esc` simultaneously while on a desktop) to achieve an instantly clear slate.

An example of three spotlight channels approach is below. Slack allows you to organize your sidebar of starred channels with <b>[custom sections](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections)</b> to visibly raise or lower their priority level, giving you control over what you see first.

1. Channels important to my job (e.g. a team member in Kørmit may star `#kørmit`, `#kormit-tech`)
1. Channels important to the Lab (e.g. `#thelabchannel`, `#practical-stuff-in-dsb`, `#labs_tool_channel`)
1. Channels important to my interests (e.g. `#music`, `#inspiration`)


### Manage your Slack notifications
Below are helpful links to best practices and tips on managing your notifications and reducing noise in Slack. We encourage you to regularly check your notification settings to ensure you get more notifications of what _is_ important/relevant to you, and less of what _isn't_.
